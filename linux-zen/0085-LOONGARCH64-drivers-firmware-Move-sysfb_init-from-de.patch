Subject: [PATCH 85/89] [LOONGARCH64] drivers/firmware: Move sysfb_init() from
 device_initcall to fs_initcall

Consider a configuration like this:
1, efifb (or simpledrm) is built-in;
2, a native display driver (such as radeon) is also built-in.

As Javier said, this is not a common configuration (the native display
driver is usually built as a module), but it can happen and cause some
trouble.

In this case, since efifb, radeon and sysfb are all in device_initcall()
level, the order in practise is like this:

efifb registered at first, but no "efi-framebuffer" device yet. radeon
registered later, and /dev/fb0 created. sysfb_init() comes at last, it
registers "efi-framebuffer" and then causes an error message "efifb: a
framebuffer is already registered". Make sysfb_init() to be subsys_
initcall_sync() can avoid this. And Javier Martinez Canillas is trying
to make a more general solution in commit 873eb3b11860 ("fbdev: Disable
sysfb device registration when removing conflicting FBs").

However, this patch still makes sense because it can make the screen
display as early as possible (We cannot move to subsys_initcall, since
sysfb_init() should be executed after PCI enumeration).

This is a better version of commit 60aebc9559492cea ("drivers/firmware:
Move sysfb_init() from device_initcall to subsys_initcall_sync") since
the previous commit leads to blank displays on some systems. The reason
is that vgaarb initialization is also a subsys_initcall_sync function so
sysfb_disable() is sometimes missed. So here we move sysfb_init() to an
fs_initcall function which is ensured after vgaarb initialization.
