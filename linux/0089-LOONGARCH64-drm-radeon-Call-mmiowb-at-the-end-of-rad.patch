Subject: [PATCH 89/89] [LOONGARCH64] drm/radeon: Call mmiowb() at the end of
 radeon_ring_commit()

Commit fb24ea52f78e0d595852e ("drivers: Remove explicit invocations of
mmiowb()") remove all mmiowb() in drivers, but it says:

"NOTE: mmiowb() has only ever guaranteed ordering in conjunction with
spin_unlock(). However, pairing each mmiowb() removal in this patch with
the corresponding call to spin_unlock() is not at all trivial, so there
is a small chance that this change may regress any drivers incorrectly
relying on mmiowb() to order MMIO writes between CPUs using lock-free
synchronisation."

The mmio in radeon_ring_commit() is protected by a mutex rather than a
spinlock, but in the mutex fastpath it behaves similar to spinlock and
need a mmiowb() to make sure the wptr is up-to-date for hardware.

Without this, we get such an error when run 'glxgears' on weak ordering
architectures such as LoongArch:
